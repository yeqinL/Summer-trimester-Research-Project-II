Topic : How much energy is there when storms come?
There are three code files, corresponding to the parts of my paper.
Energy_and_Energy_per_meter_of_geopotential_height is about calculating the energy and energy per geopotential meter of the storms in the sample set.
Turbien_output_power_100mEnergy is about to calculate the turbine output power and 100m energy in the air, and compare both of them
The last file is about constructing the automatic system.
The data file is gotten from ECMWF, we can download the data from them. Due to the large memory of the data, it is hard to upload here.
If you need the data, please contact with me.
